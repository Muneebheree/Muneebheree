# 👋 Hi there, I'm Moneeb — Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Engineer | Marketing Data Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub! This space is a curated portfolio of my journey through data — from extracting and transforming raw information into valuable insights, to building scalable data pipelines that power smarter decisions.

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a data professional with a hybrid background in **marketing analytics** and **data engineering**, currently based in London. My journey started in marketing strategy, where I learned the art of storytelling through numbers. Today, I blend that foundation with modern data engineering tools to build robust, insight-driven solutions — with a growing focus on **customer journey analytics**, **pipeline automation**, and **data quality frameworks**.

🔍 **What drives me?**  
The desire to transform messy data into meaningful, actionable stories — and to automate the boring stuff so teams can focus on what really matters.

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript
**Data Tools:** BigQuery, dbt, Dataform, Apache Airflow, Excel, Power BI  
**Cloud Platforms:** GCP (BigQuery, Cloud Functions, Cloud Scheduler), AWS (S3, Glue, Athena – learning)  
**Workflow & Automation:** Git, GitHub Actions, Cloud Logging, CI/CD pipelines  
**Other:** GA4, Looker Studio, dbt assertions, dbt tests, data quality scorecards, regex, web scraping
